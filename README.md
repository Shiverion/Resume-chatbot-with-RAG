# 🧠 Career Conversations Chatbot

A smart conversational agent designed to help users reflect on their career goals, aspirations, and experiences — with the help of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built with ❤️ using `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, and `OpenAI`, then deployed via Hugging Face Spaces or locally. Grounded responses based on uploaded CV using a lightweight RAG setup, combining context injection with vector database retrieval.

## 🧘‍♂️ What Kind of Chatbot Is This?
Think of it as a career coach meets your inner voice — thoughtful, slightly cheeky, and curious about your goals. It’ll ask you things like:

- “What’s one project you’re proud of and why?”

- “What do you value more: impact or income?”

- “Which part of your resume feels like ‘you’ the most?”

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This chatbot is like your personal career therapist (but less judgmental and more available). It:

- Lets you upload your CV and extract insights from it.
- Uses RAG to ground responses based on your background.
- Helps simulate coaching-style conversations for personal growth, job prep, or self-reflection.
- Can be extended with embeddings, vector stores, or agent workflows.

## 🧩 Core Features

- 🔍 **Document-based Chat (RAG)**: Grounded responses using your uploaded CV or resume.
- 🤖 **LLM-powered Responses**: Powered by OpenAI ChatGPT models.
- 🌐 **FastAPI App**: Lightweight, fast backend.
- ⚡ **Deployment-ready**: Works locally and on Hugging Face Spaces.
- 🐍 **Pythonic & Modular**: Easy to extend with more logic (e.g., agents, tools, function calling).
